# How to work with Git

# General 

## What is Git?
Git is a version control system that developers use all over the world. It helps you track different versions of your code and collaborate with other developers. But Git is not just for code, it can be used for any kind of text document.

# Setup Git

# Get Started with your Github project
In the last tutorial we used a "*fork*" to create a copie of the project in your own Github account. <br>

## Get your project url
In this Step we will now copie the project to your computer. Therfore we will use the "*clone*" function on Github by pressing the green **Code** button. <br>

In the clone window you can copy your *project url*
